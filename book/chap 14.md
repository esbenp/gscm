# Measuring and Managing Logistics Performance

## Learning objectives

* Supply Chain Metrics, Performance Measurement, Key Performance Indicators and the Balanced Score Card
* Total Landed Costs (or Total Cost of Ownership)
* 3PL cost models and service level agreements (SLA)

## Notes

* Driving forces for performance measurement
    * Increased reliance on contract manufacturers
        * Outsourcing by manufacturing companies is increasing
        * Electronics, e.g. Apple, HP etc.
        * KPIs is needed to measure performance of suppliers (manufacturers, LSPs etc.)
    * Strategic importane of LSPs to supply chain success
        * Often a end-customer does not interact with the company until point of delivery
        * Therefore his experience with the LSP often reflects directly on the company
    * Adoption of manufacturing management principles
        * Increased pressure for LSPs to adopt principles such as JIT, total quality management, 
        six sigma, lean principles etc. 
        * This push forced them to be better at measuring key areas of performance
    * Impact on customer experience
        * Today customers have much more choices and are much better informed 
        * Therefore understanding performance through quality programmes, customer polls 
        and customer service metrics is important
    * Increased competition
        * Increasingly large 3PLs are dominating logistics. 
    * Information technology improvements
        * Improvements in IT has made it possible to utilize the vast amounts of data 
        without significant footwork.
    * Empowerment practices
        * Increasingly lower level employees are given tasks and responsibilities once reserved 
        for management
        * KPIs are important to measuring employees performance
    * Employee motivation
        * It has become increasingly popular to use KPIs as a motivation driver for employees
* Typical warehouse metrics
    * Receiving
        * Metrics on receiving products into the warehouse is the foundation for all warehouse metrics
    * Put-away
        * The movement of product from receiving into actual storage
    * Inventory accuracy
        * Cycle counts to determine how accurate the system quantities are
* Logistics costs performance
    * Total landed costs
        * Costs including
            * Vendor and packaging costs
            * Transportation costs
            * Working capital employed/opportunity costs
            * Costs associated with risk mitigation
            * Broker fees
            * Insurance costs
            * Taxes and duties
            * Management costs
            * Reverse logistics costs
        * 3PL cost models
            * Cost plus margin
                * Warehouse space will be charged at a fixed cost per square or cubic metre
                * Completely transparent to the customer
                * Costs divided into different parts (IT, material handling equipment (MHE) depreciation, staff costs etc.)
                * A profit margin is added to the total cost
                * Pros
                    * Transparent
                    * Risk is reduced since customer is able to budget, and 3PL is certain costs are covered
                * Cons
                    * No incentive for 3PL to cost reduce since this would decrease profit margin
                    * Resources may be fixed to match peak perioid. Not build for quiter seasons.
                    * Difficult for 3PL to negotitate higher margins as these have to be matched the competition
            * Transactional pricing
                * 3PL use all resources and quote a unit rate for activities
                * Examples
                    * Receiving charged per carton or per pallet
                    * Storage charged per fcarton or pallet on a weekly or monthly basis
                    * Picking and handling out a unit, carton or pallet 
                * Pros
                    * 3PL is highly motivated to increase efficiency to increase profits
                    * Resources are not fixed by customer. Ie. better efficiency in peak/quiter periods
                * Cons
                    * Customer may not always get best customer service unless it pays seperately 
                    * Special requests should be charged seperately, as the base rates in general should 
                    cover a minimum level of service
                    * The customer does not have completely transparency over the resources employed
            * Alternative pricing models
                * A complex customised prizing model
        * Service level agreements (SLA)
            * Often include
                * Roll-out and duration of the service or process being purchased
                * Scope of services
                * Areas of responsibility
                * Performance metrics
