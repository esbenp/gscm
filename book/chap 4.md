# Supply Chain Strategies

## Strategy

* The traditional strategy formulation takes a top-down approach
	1. Start out with **corporate strategy** - the financial and growth targets for the overall organisation as a whole
	2. Below the organisation level is what is referred to as **the business unit level** - many organisations are divided into business units which focus on specific *products* or *markets*
	3. Tbe final level is referred to as **functional strategy** which is the development of strategy within specfic areas of activiy within a business unit (marketing, IT, logistics etc.)
* The top-down approach looks at the organisation in functional silos
* In contrast SCM takes a cross-functional, process-based perspective

## The evolution of manufacturing

* **Craft production** was manufacturing in the past. Skilled artisans produced customised goods for individual customers. This meant **high output variety, low output volume**
* In the early twintieth century we got **mass production** (Henry Ford). The caused the **low output variety, high output volume**

## Lean production

* In the 1930s Toyota pioneered the lean production methodology through their production system known as the Toyota Production System (TPS)
* Emphasis was on total flows through the system instead of the efficiency of individual machines
* TPS sought to become **pull** based instead of **push** based to prevent stockpiling of inventory.
* This is known as **Just-in-time (JIT)** inventory replenishment. Here inventory is kept at a minimum and replenished only as used.
* TPS sought to eliminate waste and efficiencies in 7 key areas
	1. Overproduction: **make-to-order (MTO)** instead of **make-to-stock (MTS)**
	2. Waiting: work-in-progress (WIPs) that waits around for operators or machinery to become available
	3. Transportation: is a non-value adding process. Think of bananas rippening in transit.
	4. Inappropriate processing: some systems might apply the same processing for all products, even though it is only required for some
	5. Unnecessary inventory: holding inventory just-in-case is expensive
	6. Unnecessary motion: some systems might move products unnecessarily. An example in ch 6 is where a supplier moves a product from region X to consolidation centre in region Y, only for the product to be moved back to a distribution center in region X.
	7. Defects: can cause time delay as it may be necessary to find the cause of the defect.
* Key concept of lean: **Ensure that value is added at each stage of the process (the value stream)**

## Agile supply chains and mass customisations

* A supply chain model that deals with volatility of demand
* Described as 'the ability to respond rapidly to unpredictable changes in demand'
* **Mass customisation** or **postponed production** are often key enablers of agile supply chains
	* Uses a production philosophy known as **principle of postponement**
	* Try to reduce the amount of parallel production lines and standardise products until the **decoupling point** where the base product is turned into the final product configured by the customer. Dell is a great case.
	* Another great case is painting. Think of the numerous SKU variations. Today pain stores own primary colors and a mixer machine that will mix primary colors to the ordered color.

## Combined logistics strategies

* Professor Marshall Fischer suggested two types of supply chains are required for two types of products: (1) **efficient supply chains** for functional products and (2) **responsive supply chains** for innovative products
	* Functional products are products with predictable demand, long product life cycle, low variety and long lead times
	* Innovative products are the opposite
* *Christopher et al.* put forward a taxonomy for selecting global supply chain strategies.
* **Lead time** is the time it takes for stock to be replenished
|                     | Predictable demand                 | Unpredictable demand      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Long lead time**  | Lean: Plan and exectute (3)        | Leagile: Postponement (4) |
| **Short lead time** | Lean: Continuous replenishment (1) | Agile: Quick response (2) |
	1. Lean, continuous replenishment: when demand is predictable and lead times are short. For example when a supplier is making regular deliveries to a retailer. Over time steady demand patterns emerge. 
	2. Agile, quick response: when lead times are still short, but demand is unpredictable. Zara is a great case. Their supply chain is designed to be responsive as to translate into the latest fashion trends within a very short amount of time. This is highly attributable to postponed production where base product is transferred into the final product very late in the production.
	3. Lean, plan and execute: lead times are longer than continuous replenishment. The difference here is that planning is required well in advance.
	4. Leagile, postponement: a hybrid strategy. Manufacturing of the base product might take place at a remote location using lean strategy. It is then shipped to a place nearer final market and transformed into final product using an agile strategy.
