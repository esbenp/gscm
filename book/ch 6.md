# Transport in supply chains

* The six modes of transport
	* Air
	* Road
	* Water
	* Rail
	* Pipeline
	* The information superhighway
* **Intermodal transport** is where freight moves within a loading unit (**Intermodal transport unit or ITU**)
	* The unit may move upon different modes of transport
	* The freight remains within the unit at all times
	* Most common examples are standard types containers (20 and 40ft length)
* **Logistics service provider (LSP)** costs
	* LSPs have to recover certain fixed costs for a consigment
	* For heavy shipments, rate per kilo is used
	* For bulky shipments, rate per volume (**volumetric charging**)

## Characteristics of different modes of transport

|   Mode   | Costs                                               | Speed | Capacity |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Road     | Low fixed cost, medium variable (fuel, maintenance) | Good  | Medium   |
| Air      | Fixed cost low, high variable (fuel, maintenance)   | High  | Medium   |
| Rail     | Fied cost high, low variable                        | Good  | High     |
| Water    | Fixed cost medium, low variable                     | Slow  | Very high|
| Pipeline | Fixed cost high, low variable                       |       |          |

* Road is favorable in that it can provide direct access to the delivery point
* Maritime is the dominant mode in international transport
* Road is the dominant mode in inland transport
* **Freight tonne kilometres (FTKs)** is volume of freight measured in tonnes times the distance travelled in kilometres

## Distribution centres, consolidation centres and factory gate pricing

* **Distribution centres (DCs)** take responsibility of delivering goods to stores
* **Consolidation centres (CCs)** consolidate deliveries from multiple suppliers into full loads that are transported to DCs
* **Factory gate pricing (FGP)** is a new development where retailers themselves organise the transport from supplier -> Store/DC/CC
	 * FGP increases supply chain visibility
	 * Higher delivery service levels
	 * FGP allow retailers to focus on core competency: for example in grocery industry this is efficient delivery of products
* **FCL** refer to full container loads (transport directly to DC)
* **LCL** refer to less than full container loads (transport to CC)
