# Logistics service providers

* **Consignor** is the company or individual sending the consigment
* **Consignee** is the company or individual receiving the consignment

## Classifying logistics companies

* Increasingly companies move from **own-account transportation** towards using LSPs
* When companies outsource they often use more than 1 LSP to ensure competitive rates or because different LSPs have strengths or expertise in certain markets or services
* 5 categories of LSPs
	* **Hauliers** or trucking companies: carry freight on trucks
	* **Freight forwarders**: agents, that arrange transportation for freight. Includes arranging customs, change of transportation mode etc.
	* **Non-vessel-owning common carrier (NVOCC)**: consolidates smaller shipments into full container loads which the NVOCC takes responsibility for
	* **Couriers**: operates mainly within dense urban areas, for example bike messengers
	* **Integrators**: provide seamless, end-to-end solutions. FexEx, UPS, DHL are examples. Main selling point is that they take over the entire process from consignor to consignee, including the risk.

##  Third-party logistics companies (3PL)

* LSPs that provide multiple logistics services, in an integrated fashion
* Examples of services
	* Transportation: often in different modes
	* Warehousing: including providing capacity for seasonal fluctuations
	* Pick and pack: SKUs into packages
	* Light manufacturing
	* Vendor managed inventory
	* Customs clearance
	* Trade financing: for example mitigating currency exposure
	* Managing reverse logistics: returns and repairs
	* Parts distribution
	* Inventory management

## Fourth-party logistics (4PL)

* A concept coined by Accenture meaning the complete outsourcing of supply chains
* 3PLs often provide 4PL-like services. For example a complete solution that encompasses services acquired by 3PL competitors

## Carrier responsibilities

* A **bill of lading**, or in air freight **air waybill** is a document describing a freight. Who owns it, what does i comprise of, the delivery and insurance terms (incoterms) etc.
* Incoterms describes when and who is responsible for **cost**, **risk** and **insurance**
