# Globalisation and international trade

## Growth in international trade

* Regional trade agreements such as EU and ASEAN have allowed for increasingly trade within regions and thus internationally

## Logistics performance

* Transport mobility
	* A measure for the availability and quality of transportation services in a given country
	* Is is correlated quite closely with the GDP of the country
* Global logistics performance index (LPI)
	* An index maintained by the World Bank that ranks 155 countries in terms of their logistics performance, the six key dimensions are
		* Customs
		* Infrastructure
		* International shipments
		* Logistics competence
		* Tracking and tracing
		* Timeliness
* Liner shipping connectivity index (LSCI)
	* An index maintained by UNCTAD which measures 162 coastal countries' access to container shipping services, the index consists of 5 components
		* The largest vessel deployed on services to a country's ports (Larger vessels = deeper ports and specialized cranes)
		* No. of companies that provide services to the country's ports (More companies = more choices and lower prices)
		* The number of services offered by the liner companies
		* The number of ships deployed on services to a country's ports (more ships = higher frequencey)
		* The twenty-foot-equivalent (TEU) capacity on deployed ships (economies of scale and lower freight costs)

## Globalisation

* Multinational companies (MNCs)
	* Companies with overseas presence, ie. operations behond their home country
* Transnational corporations (TNCs)
	* Companies that trade across many borders, with operations in multiple countries
	* Often difficult to identify the home country of a TNC
* Ethnocentricity
	* The company does business abroad, but thinks and acts as if it were still operating in the home country
* Polycentricity
	* Where the company adopts the host country perspective (when in Rome, do as the Romans do)
* Geocentricity
	* The company acts completely independent of geography of its operations and adopts a global perspective and will tailor to the local environment as needed (see Glocalisation)
* Foreign direct investment (FDI)
	* When a company of one country invests capital in another country (for example a TNC invest heavily to have core company functions located in other countries than its home)
* Example of decission factors when selecting a site for FDI
	* Labour costs
	* Employment regulations
	* Transport and logistics costs
	* Transport linkages
	* Political stability
	* Currency stability
	* Benefits of being part of a cluster of similar companies
	* etc.

## Directional imbalances

* Freight is most often one-way, and the bulk quantity of freight is not equal in both directions.
* For example much freight moves from Asia to USA, but not much moves from USA to Asia
* Directional imbalances create high differences in transportation costs
* Sometimes imbalances exist between types of commodities. For example if one end of a route has a significant surplus of containers for perishable goods, sending these in the opposite direction will be relatively cheaper
* Traditional system
	* Vessels move in both directions on each route
* Circular system
	* Vessels move in one direction only, preferably in the direction of greatest traffic volume
