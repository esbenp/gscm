# Information Flows and Technology

* Key drivers of developing a sophisticated supply chain
    * Information complexity
    * Proliferation
    * Diffusion
    * Velocity
    * Accuracy
* Barriers to gaining information visibility and transparency
    * Cultural
        * Information will not be shared effectively without collaboration in the supply chain.
        Therefore disparity between trading partners' capabilities and information security can 
        be considered cultural barriers to obtaining information visibility.
    * Financial
        * It is expensive to implement and maintain supply chain-spanning information technology. 
        These cost implecations can become *financial barriers* if the beforementioned disparity exists. 
        For example it would be unreasonable for a major supermarket to expect their small-scale third- or 
        fourth-tier suppliers to implement cutting-edge information systems.
    * Technical
        * Each supply chain partner needs to be able to 'talk' to one another. And the data to 
        be shared need to be chosen. Hence complex *technical barriers* exist.
    * Organizational
        * Divergent processes can exist within a single organization. These would need to be realigned 
        to obtain information visibility.
