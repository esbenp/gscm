# Information Flows and Technology

* Key drivers of developing a sophisticated supply chain
    * Information complexity
    * Proliferation
    * Diffusion
    * Velocity
    * Accuracy
* Barriers to gaining information visibility and transparency
    * Cultural
        * Information will not be shared effectively without collaboration in the supply chain.
        Therefore disparity between trading partners' capabilities and information security can 
        be considered cultural barriers to obtaining information visibility.
    * Financial
        * It is expensive to implement and maintain supply chain-spanning information technology. 
        These cost implecations can become *financial barriers* if the beforementioned disparity exists. 
        For example it would be unreasonable for a major supermarket to expect their small-scale third- or 
        fourth-tier suppliers to implement cutting-edge information systems.
    * Technical
        * Each supply chain partner needs to be able to 'talk' to one another. And the data to 
        be shared need to be chosen. Hence complex *technical barriers* exist.
    * Organizational
        * Divergent processes can exist within a single organization. These would need to be realigned 
        to obtain information visibility.
* Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
    * Put on physical freight. Invidual items, batches or containers. Used to identify products in systems.
    * Reader often referred to as 'reader gate'
    * Gives real time product information
    * Primary applications
        * Asset tracking and management
        * Increased security of freight
        * Improved stock management and availability
        * Reduced errors in product data handling
    * Operational improvements
        * Shipping consolidation
        * Conveyance loading
        * Conveyance tracking
        * Shipment and item tracking
        * Verification
        * Storage
        * Item tracking within a manufacturing plant
        * Warehouse efficiency, reach, productivity and accuracy
        * Reduced retail out of stuck, labour requirements, pilferage and phantom stock problems
    * Not yet fully envisaged
    * Still high cost
* Benefits of data capture technologies
    * Paper-based/handwritten
        * Pros
            * Proven technology
            * Minimal training for use
            * Low cost to implement and maintain
        * Cons
            * High potential for human error
            * Poor traceability (potential for damage/loss of data)
            * Requires literate operator
            * Does not integrate with other information systems
            * Time-consuming data input and extraction
        * Summary
            * Low-cost, low tech solution
    * Bar coding and radio data terminals
        * Pros
            * Proven technology - robust
            * Minimal training for use
            * Low cost to maintain
            * Good data traceability
            * Virtual data storage
            * Integration with other information systems
            * Fast data input
        * Cons
            * Some potential for human error (e.g. mis-scans)
            * Requires human operator in most warehouse functions
            * Requires literate operator
            * Some cost to implementation
        * Summary
            * A robust off-the-shelf solution
    * RFID
        * Pros
            * Automatic data capture (human operator not required)
            * Potential to minimise human input and therefore error
            * Real-time data input, and extraction
        * Cons
            * High cost to implement
            * High cost to maintain (unless tags are reusable)
            * Early stages of adoption and therefore still high risk
            * Technologies still in development
            * Not all solutions are robust
        * Summary
            * A solution that eliminates human error, but currently has high entry
            barriers
    * Supply chain knowledge management
        * The capture, storage, use and sharing of knowledge within the supply chain
* Global standards
    * GS1 is a global standards organization
    * GTIN is the consumer barcode
    * EPCglobal standards system, EPC = electronic product code, is for RFID
    * Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) provides data on products identified using GS1, GTIN etc.
