* Transport cost sensitivity
	* How sensitive is freight to shipment. Increased value/decreased volume = lower transport senitivity
* Material substitution
	* The replacement of physical product by virtual product
* Cargo = freight + mail
* A supply chain encompases a number of key flows:
	* Physical flow of materials
	* Flows of information that inform the supply chain
	* Resources (especially finance, but also people (labour) and equipment). 
		* Not all resources in the supply chain are tangible, for example good quality intercompany relationships are often cited as an important ingredient of effective supply chains.
* Echelon is sometimes used to refer to different parts of the supply chain
* Links and nodes
	* A link refers to the links between two nodes, for example transport services
	* A node is an entity in a supply chain, for example a warehouse
* SCM vs logistics perspectives
	* Traditionalist
		* SCM is a subset of logistics, meaning it is an add-on
    * Re-labelling
    	* Logistics has been re-labelled as SCM
    * Unionist
    	* Logistics is a part of a larger entity SCM
    * Intersectionist
    	* Logistics and SCM overlap in some places, however both have separate and distinctive parts as well
