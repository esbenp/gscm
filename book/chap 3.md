# Supply chain relationships

## Outsourcing

* Outsourcing can be defined as the transfer to a third party of the management and delivery of a process previously perfomed by the company itself
* Reasons to outsource
	* Decreased costs
	* Increased flexibility
	* A wish to focus on core competencies
	* Rapid avancement in technology might cause the company to have outdated technology, whilst outsource partners have updated
* **Service level agreement (SLA)**
	* A key part of contractual agreement between service partners. Legally binding.
	* Identifies upfront the performance (ie. service levels) expected
	* Potential suppliers will have to meet those expectations before given serious considerations
* **Order qualifiers**
	* The minimum service level to be achieved by a supplier in order to be given serious consideration by the buyer
* **Order winners**
	* The service level to be achieved by a supplier in order to win a given order
* **Supplier development**
	* Efforts being made, from both parties, to improve efforts to build better products and solutions
* Virtual organisations
	* Companies that outsource all processes
* **Vertical integration**
	* How much of the upstream and downstream activities the company owns
* Tiered supplier perspective
	* Top-tier manufacturer or client organisation is the ultimate client, ie. the company actually selling the final product. This is also often referred to as an **original equipment manufacturer (OEM)**
	* Contract manufacturers are the lower tier suppliers that supply parts for the OEM to assemble
* **Design for manufacture (DFM)**
	* Simchi-Levi et al. describe how in the 1980s designers and engineers started to design products with consideration of the actual manufacturing process to enable lower costs and efficiency. Tiered supplier structure can be a key enabler of DFM. DFM in turn enables delayed product differentiation.

## Offshoring

* Offshoring is the transfer if specific processes to lower cost locations in other countries
* Fewer regulatory controls and lower wages have caused mass migration of manufacturing from the developed world to emergent economies
* Examples of offshoring
	* Manufacturing
	* Call centers
	* Transaction processing (accounting, invoicing)
	* HR
* Should a process be outsourced?
	* **Cost savings < Monitoring costs + transaction costs**
* Some reasons for offshoring
	* Lower costs in offshore regions
	* Lower communication and IT costs
	* Improving capabilities in many offshore regions
* **Nearshoring** is when you offshore close to the home market to minimize risk and delays
* **Backshoring** is when a company abandon an offshoring project and move the activities back to the home market
* Reasons for outsourcing failure
	* Customer complaints
	* Late delivery
	* Differenes in culture
	* Time difference

## Evaluating and selecting outsourcees

1. Determine whether or not the supplier meets the order qualifiers
	* Examples of qualifiers
	* Reliability of delivery
	* Quality certifications
	* Delivery lead time
	* etc.
2. Does the outsourcee conform to ethical expectations (CSR)?
3. What order qualifiers are **order-losing sensitive qualifiers**?
	* Some qualifiers are more important than others. If the outsourcee does not conform to those it will not win the order
4. If qualifiers are met and no previous work experience exist between outsourcee and outsourcer then it is important to look at the differene between working environments using the **environmental separation index (ESI)**
	* A higher value of ESI indicates large differences in work practices, culture and perceptions between the outsourcer and outsourcee
	* The outsourcer should also consider how critical the process is to its core business

## Outsourcer and outsourcee relationship development

* In a **supplier development** context it is important to not only consider the cost-benefit but the total cost of outsourcing (including monitoring, cost of setting up a relationship, cost of risk etc.)
* Research show outsourcer-outsourcee relationships can move through 4 stages
	1. **Master-servant stage**: conventional relationship. The outsourcer sets rules and expectations and the outsourcee delivers. Low cost is the main driver of the arrangement.
	2. **Consultative stage**: consultant-client relationship. The outsourcer consults with the outsourcee on a regular basis. Cost, quality, reliability and responsiveness are important to sustain the arrangement.
	3. **Peer-to-peer relationship stage**: The ideal stage of collaborative results and synergistic long-term relationship creating a win-win situtation for the parties
	4. **Competetive stage**: The outsourcee starts to take the leading role and competes with the outsourcer in global markets.

## Supply chain integration

* Is **not** collaboration. Collaboration is the relationship between supply chain partners developed over time. Integration is alignment and interlinking of business processes using for example **electronic data interchange (EDI)**, Scala etc.
* There are primarily 4 modes of integration
	1. **Internal integration**: departments within the organisation are integrated (sales, HR, marketing etc.)
	2. **Backward integration**: integration with selected first-tier and increasingly second-tier suppliers
	3. **Forward integration**: integration with selected first-tier customers or service providers (LSPs etc.). Forward integration with second-tier customers is uncommon.
	4. **Forward and backward integration**: integration with both suppliers and customers. Ideal, but rare.
* Forward and backward integration can be classified as **external integration**
* Information technologies are enablers of integration, however optimal and uniform organisational structures are a prerequisite

## Supply chain collaboration

* **Vertial collaboration** is collaboration between suppliers and customers
* **Horizontal collaboration** is collaboration between competitors and other supply chain actors
* **Supply base rationalisation** is reducing the amount of upstream suppliers to decrease complexity
* Occational rationalisation should be coupled with supplier development
